## What?

This application allows specified members of a team to search through
contacts stored in an ElasticSearch database.

# How?

### We use following technologies:

* HTML5, CSS3, Javascript
* [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* [Hapijs](http://hapijs.com/)
  * Main packages: env2, Handlebars, Inert, Vision
  * Testing: Lab, Code
* Databases:
  * [ElasticSearch](https://www.elastic.co/)
  * [Redis](http://redis.io/)

#### Database structure with example [here](https://github.com/FAC-GM/app/blob/master/DATA.md)

## Running the App *Locally*


Clone the Git repository from GitHub:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:FAC-GM/app.git && cd app
```

### ElasticSearch (*our primary database*)

You will need to have ***ElasticSearch*** running on your local
machine for this to work.  
If you are on Linux/Mac and ***don't want*** to install the Java Runtime
*because* [***Java*** *is* ***insecure***](https://goo.gl/cqEhN4)  
we *recommend* you use [***Vagrant***](https://github.com/dwyl/learn-vagrant)
to run ElasticSearch in a Virtual Machine.  

We have included a `Vagrantfile` with the *bare minimum* you need to
get ElasticSearch up and running. Provided you already have
Vagrant and VirtualBox installed on your machine, you can boot the ES VM
with:

```sh
vagrant up
```


### `.env` file

you will also need to have a `.env` file in the root of your project
with the following variables:

```sh
# SEARCHBOX_URL=http://paas:password@eu-west-1.searchly.com # # Ask dev team for this
SEARCHBOX_URL=http://localhost:9200
PORT=8000
ES_INDEX=gmcontact
ES_TYPE=contacts
RESULTS_PER_PAGE=10
JWT_SECRET= # Ask dev team for this
BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000
# Variable with authorised emails
#Gm app
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID= # Ask dev team for this
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET= # Ask dev team for this
MAP_ID_USER= # Ask dev team for this
```
Ask a member of the dev team for the `SEARCHBOX_URL` variable if you
want to access the *hosted* ElasticSearch Database.
There are a number of other variables missing from example above which are available to the dev team.

The MAP_ID_USER environment variable is used to map the id from the user to their first name. We are using the ids to know who creates notes and who is the "owner" of a candidate. However the application shouldn't display the id of the user but the first name and it's where MAP_ID_USER is useful. see the discussion on Github for more details: [issue 215](https://github.com/FAC-GM/app/issues/215) and [issue 238](https://github.com/FAC-GM/app/issues/238)

### Install *node.js* dependencies

```sh
npm install
```

### Run the Unit Tests

```sh
npm test
```

### Boot the App

```sh
npm start
```

Now visit http://localhost:8000 in your browser to view the site.

### Allowing new team members access to the app
Ask the **dev team** to update the variable that restricts access.


## Functionality

A running list of the of the functionality in the app as it becomes available.

+ [Login via Google](https://github.com/dwyl/hapi-auth-github), access restricted to specific team members

+ Initials of who on the team a contact is connected to are displayed
 _(in the example below, David Dupont is connected to our current dev team - Simon L and Anita C)_

![Initials-of-who-contact-is-connected-to](wireframes/initials.png)

* 'Favourite' contact profiles by clicking the grey star in the corner of the profile page

![favouriting-a-contact-functionality](wireframes/star2.png)

+ Quickly visualise who has been favourited in the search results (denoted by a yellow star) and see a full list by clicking on the yellow star in the top right hand corner of the app

![how-favourites-appear-in-search-results](wireframes/favourite1.png)

## Working with this repo
Our [product backlog is our list of issues](https://github.com/FAC-GM/app/issues).

We use labels to manage these. The most interesting ones are:
+ `feature idea` - added to features that are just in idea form for now rather than _definitely_ required
+ `priority...` - labels starting with 'priority' denote the priority of the task from 1 to 5, with 1 being the highest
+ `T...` - labels starting with 'T' denote time estimates for the task; these are added **by the dev team only**, e.g. `T1d` will require one day to complete
  + `m` = minutes
  + `h` = hours
  + `d` = days
+ `in progress` - denotes which tasks are currently being worked on
+ `help wanted` - used mostly internally by the dev team when outside help is required to move an issue forward
+ `technical` - used **by the dev team** to denote technical tasks

## Google Analytics

Google Analytics is enabled for all pages of the App.
If you want access to the stats, please ask a member of the dev team.
